# Cplusplus-Corny-Mad-Lib-Game

My Mad Lib code is basically a game where you are prompted to enter about 14 pieces of random information. Using that, my program will then spit out a story (I will try to improve the story over time). Keep in mind, this is meant to be funny; so please be upset if the generated story is offensive. If anything, its your fault!
